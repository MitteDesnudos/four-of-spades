        The stakes were high. The Manila four-piece – most of them hardly 20 years old at the time – shot to fame shortly after releasing their first single on Warner Music Philippines in 2016. Their unabashed love of retro aesthetics and funk- and pop-inflected brand of indie rock attracted an ardent fanbase. In 2018 the band landed a huge hit with Mundo – a six-minute number with a moving solo that has racked up more than 83 million streams on Spotify.
